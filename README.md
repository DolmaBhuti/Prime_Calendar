- The problem that we are solving is that given our current online-hybrid education structure, students often have difficulty managing their time effectively and keeping up with deadlines. 
- The problem impacts students by causing them to miss deadlines and/or have ineffective work and study sessions.  With no organisation of work and breaks. This can lead to burn-out, feelings of anxiety and stress. 
- A successful solution will allow students to learn effective time management and to stay on top of their responsibilities.  ​
- It can remind them when their class starts, assignments are due all on a easy to user calendar interface. To add, there is a note-taking component for each class that will auto-save their notations for next time. Not to mention, you can export the notes taken to a pdf which can be shared or used offline by the user. 
- It will also allow the user to set up a timer for study sessions and break times maximizing efficiency and a higher success rate. ​
- Having a clearly defined schedule and enforcing some level of structure to their work sessions using timers could prevent students from working too little or working too much in one sitting. It’ll encourage the student to concentrate for the selected time.  ​
